# Assignment 1.1 — Option Surface Lab

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Assigned | Class 1 |
| Checkpoint | Start of Class 2 — 3-minute live demo. Show progress, ask questions. The site does not have to be published yet. |
| Due | **Monday, Sep 07 at 11:59pm** (extended from Fri Sep 04) |
| Collaboration | Discussion encouraged. Code must be yours (AI-assisted is yours). |
| AI use | Fully permitted and expected. You own every line you submit. |
| Submission | Publish to GitHub Pages; the site must render. Submit the link on Canvas. |

> **Instructor update (announcement).** The earlier assignment `.zip` shipped
> stale instructions with a **wrong field name** — it said `SETTLE` where the
> correct field is `MID_PRICE`. This README reflects the corrected Canvas
> version. Also:
>
> - **Reflex is not required.** "You do not have to use reflex, implementation
>   details are up to you, build your app how you see fit."
> - **Publish on GitHub Pages.** Some app functionality will be lost by going
>   static; that is expected and fine.

This is the first layer of an app that will keep growing all semester. Every homework adds something to the same site.

The job this week is options data — including **expired** contracts — plus the workflow you will use for the rest of the course.

> **What you are actually going to discover:** options data is sparse. Many of
> the contracts you want have no price on the day you want it for the strike you
> want. That is the nature of the instrument. Simulating a realistic fill on an
> option that barely trades requires the volatility surface, which is next week.
> For example, what was the price of the near-the-money contract on *morning*,
> not the close?
>
> This week you only need to *see* the holes. For the next assignment we will
> fold in the volatility surface and calculate reasonable simulated fills.

## Learning objectives

- Pull and cache historical prices for expired option contracts.
- Treat options data as sparse and misleading, not as a filled sheet.
- Build an interactive app with charts and widget switches.
- See, concretely, where the data runs out.

## What to turn in

A link to your GitHub Pages hosted site that contains a working version of your
app. You can serve it as an html file like we discussed in class, or you can
take a few extra steps and deploy the frontend portion of your app. Your choice,
but the html file is probably simplest.

Your app must support the following functionality:

1. Loads the cached LSEG pickle containing your fetched data.
2. Parses each RIC into `{underlying, expiry, put/call, strike}` and a tidy long
   table: one row per contract per date. `parse_option_ric()` already knows the
   scheme in Appendix A.
3. Shows a 3D figure of puts or calls for one as-of date. An example has been
   provided for you, yours may differ.
4. Plots **both** `MID_PRICE` and `TRDPRC_1` so a stranger can see they are not
   the same series.
5. Prints two numbers on the page:
   - percent of listed series that day with a mid and **no** trade
   - median `|MID_PRICE − TRDPRC_1|` on series that have both
6. Changes the color scheme and format into a graphical identity that you like
   and are happy with. Be as creative as you want.

Write three sentences under the plot:

- Where is the cloud of price data dense, and where is it empty?
- Why is interpolating across empty cells dangerous on a $0.50 strike grid for a
  name like UUUU?
- Which field will you treat as the mark next week, and which field will you
  treat as evidence that someone traded?

## The two prices you are not allowed to confuse

- `TRDPRC_1` — last **trade** on that RIC that day. Missing on most listed
  strikes. When it exists it is one print, not a mark.
- `MID_PRICE` — the closing NBBO midpoint — `(bid + ask) / 2` at the exchange
  close. LSEG does not expose a true exchange settlement price for expired US
  equity options (the `SETTLE` field returns "universe does not support" on this
  RIC space, and `TR.SettlementPrice` comes back empty), so `MID_PRICE` is the
  closest mark-of-the-close we get. Exists on far more series than trades. On a
  name that barely trades it is still a mid of a possibly-stale quote.

If you feed `TRDPRC_1` into a surface and then read prices off the holes, you are
pricing off prints that did not happen.

## Helpful guidance

### Parse the RICs

The options frame comes back with RIC strings as column names. Turn each one into
`(underlying, expiry, type, strike)` and melt to long format.

The starter builds identifiers instead of walking a chain, because the chain
endpoint fails on expired contracts.

```
{ROOT}{M}{DD}{YY}{SSSSS}.U^{M}{YY}
```

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ROOT` | Underlying root, uppercase (e.g. `UUUU`) |
| `M` | Month letter: `A–L` = Jan–Dec **calls**; `M–X` = Jan–Dec **puts** |
| `DD` | Two-digit expiration day |
| `YY` | Two-digit year |
| `SSSSS` | Strike × 100, zero-padded to five digits (`$12.50` → `01250`) |
| `.U` | Exchange / venue qualifier |
| `^{M}{YY}` | Expired-contract suffix; repeats the month letter and year |

Example: `UUUUA1502601250.U^A26` is the UUUU 15-Jan-2026 **call** struck at $12.50.

Synthetic construction means many of the RICs you generate never existed. Request
in batches, tolerate failures, fall back to single RICs when a batch throws. The
starter already does this.

### Three things to be aware of

- The starter generates a candidate for every Friday in the window. If your name
  only lists monthlies, most of those come back empty. That is expected.
- If the underlying split inside your window, the synthetic RICs will not find the
  adjusted contracts. Check. If it split, pick something else.
- If the pull is uncomfortably slow, the starter is taking the high and low across
  the **entire** window and generating every strike in between for every expiry.
  Banding strikes per expiry cuts the request count a lot. Optional, but it will
  save you time.
